# NAIL: Neurosymbolic AI Library

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nail/badge/?version=latest)](https://nail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

_This is a gigantic WIP._

## About

The library allows you to create neurosymbolic programs that allow for symbolic
manipulation integrated with gradient-based learning on data.

Neurosybolic programs have usually involved one or more of the following:

- Learning programs from data
  - Learning programs from natural language

This library will facilitate learning abstract programs that incorporate
statistical learning into higher-order reasoning.

### Primitives

- Programs
  - Variables
  - Operations (on variables)
  - Instances (of variables)
  - Bindings (between instances of variables)

## References

[TBD]
